This was because he was suffering many minor strokes before his big one that ended his career.

This was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds rummaging thru' the DVD bargain bin at our local superstore to fulfil an obligation (i.e. to give me a present). It could have been a serendipitous find but it wasn't: this is so utterly clich\\u00c3\\u0083\\u00c2\\u00a9d, so badly written, so poorly directed, so badly acted that I'm surprised everyone involved hasn't been arrested and sent down for 10 years. God, it's awful. I suspected as much from about 30 seconds in, but carried on because sometimes - sometimes - bad films are so bad they can be enjoyable. This isn't one of them. It is simply bad.

If I could rate the first 25 minutes only, I'd probably give it an eight. As it is now, it gets a four. ...And that's being nice! <br /><br />If you're a sucker for romantic comedies you'll probably have a great time anyways.

All said and done, this is a lousy picture and I purchased the DVD for only $1.50 and I really got ripped OFF !\\\"\",\n          \"This is almost certainly the worst Western I've ever seen. The story follows a formula that is especially common to Westerns and martial arts films -- hero learns that family/friends have been murdered, so hero sets out to exact revenge, foils the ineffective lawman, rescues the kidnapped loving damsel, and murders the expert arch-nemesis in a brutal duel. This formula has often been successful -- otherwise it wouldn't be a formula -- but Gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you'll ever see. The scripting is atrociously simple-minded and insulting; it sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth, maturity, and realism. The sound is bad; it sometimes looks dubbed. The cinematography is lame, and the sets are sometimes just facades. The acting is pitiful; sure, some of the performers could blame the script, but others cannot use that excuse. I hope I never see Chris Lybbert in a speaking role ever again; every time he says a line that should be angry or mean, he does nothing more than lower the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like a kid trying to act macho. And speaking of Chris Lybbert, who plays Hopalong, check out his duds (if you dare to watch this film): He wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like Roy Rogers than a hard-working, down-and-dirty cowboy. If you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the imagined grandeur of Hopalong Cassidy, then get this, but if you have more than two neurons, watch something else.\",\n          \"OK, so I know of this movie because of a friend of mine's in it and I actually visited the set when they were filming, so from a personal stand-point, I was intrigued to finally view this obscure little gem. If you dig at all on info regarding this movie, you'll find it's mired in legal troubles (even over 7 years after being filmed) so, if you are at all like me -- then you'll do whatever it takes to obtain a copy. My source? Ebay. About $15 but I felt ripped because when I got it today in the mail, it was a very rough, grainy copy of a \\\\SCREENER ONLY\\\\\\\" release, complete with annoying top mini time-code but alas, I could still enjoy it but not as much as if I had a proper copy, something I suggest you obtain if you want the full impact this film may or may not have on you. From what I have gleaned, it's been released on DVD in Germany & now Spain. With that, good luck & happy searching/bidding...;). The score/sndtrk is worth it alone. Very eclectic and varied (somethinbg rare these days IMHO in film) -- I think that will be my next sndtrk/score to locate, but I digress... <br /><br />Now, onto the review. The film opens as Billy Zane's character is injecting a nurse in the mental ward he is apparently locked up in. He steals her clothes (even shoes) and quickly moves into a series of holding up a bank/loan shop but after escaping with the loot, well, I guess this is where the \\\\\\\"plot\\\\\\\" begins -- he inadvertently looses it. After perpetrating several campy over-the-top crimes & dalliances to various A to C-list celebs to locate the money, he finds himself somehow in a cemetery where a funeral -- I think for the dead guy he shoots in the loan office/bank, and -- even with 1950's police cars and cops looking all over for him steadily throughout -- he never gets seen or nabbed. (He sees daily newspapers reporting his \\\\\\\"crimes\\\\\\\") This I liked, because it gave the thin plot an extension. After all, it's a MOVIE (see: fiction) & director Iris Iliopulos does what I think is everything possible to 1) Bring Wood's vision to fruition and 2) Give it an updated feel, yet have shots of authentic 50's police cars intertwined with, ahh, local L.A..99$ stores -- so well hence my 9 rating. If the period and props were authentic -- I would have given it a 10. Now it wraps it self up kinda weird and I won't spoil it for anyone but let's just say the final ending is somewhat disappointing for it, to me, it had promise, action and comedy -- all up till the end, so...with ALL that said --locate a copy at your own discretion.<br /><br />Just realize that, as there is no dialouge (except for some narration and singing) this may be up your alley -- maybe not-- but I definitely think it's worth a watch. The actors all do fine performances and it's only the inconsistency in proper period pieces that really made me long for just that correction -- then I would say by all means check this film out for it's not like anything these studios put out these days (or will in the future, too) I am sure.\\\"\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

arch nemesis in a brutal duel  this formula has often been successful    otherwise it wouldn t be a formula    but gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you ll ever see  the scripting is atrociously simple minded and insulting  it sounds like a high schooler wrote the dialogue because it lacks depth  maturity  and realism  the sound is bad  it sometimes looks dubbed  the cinematography is lame  and the sets are sometimes just facades  the acting is pitiful  sure  some of the performers could blame the script  but others cannot use that excuse  i hope i never see chris lybbert in a speaking role ever again  every time he says a line that should be angry or mean  he does nothing more than lower the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like a kid trying to act macho  and speaking of chris lybbert  who plays hopalong  check out his duds  if you dare to watch this film   he wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like roy rogers than a hard working  down and dirty cowboy  if you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves merely to worship the imagined grandeur of hopalong cassidy  then get this  but if you have more than two neurons  watch something else \",\n          \"ok  so i know of this movie because of a friend of mine s in it and i actually visited the set when they were filming  so from a personal stand point  i was intrigued to finally view this obscure little gem  if you dig at all on info regarding this movie  you ll find it s mired in legal troubles  even over   years after being filmed  so  if you are at all like me    then you ll do whatever it takes to obtain a copy  my source  ebay  about     but i felt ripped because when i got it today in the mail  it was a very rough  grainy copy of a  screener only   release  complete with annoying top mini time code but alas  i could still enjoy it but not as much as if i had a proper copy  something i suggest you obtain if you want the full impact this film may or may not have on you  from what i have gleaned  it s been released on dvd in germany   now spain  with that  good luck   happy searching bidding       the score sndtrk is worth it alone  very eclectic and varied  somethinbg rare these days imho in film     i think that will be my next sndtrk score to locate  but i digress      now  onto the review  the film opens as billy zane s character is injecting a nurse in the mental ward he is apparently locked up in  he steals her clothes  even shoes  and quickly moves into a series of holding up a bank loan shop but after escaping with the loot  well  i guess this is where the   plot   begins    he inadvertently looses it  after perpetrating several campy over the top crimes   dalliances to various a to c list celebs to locate the money  he finds himself somehow in a cemetery where a funeral    i think for the dead guy he shoots in the loan office bank  and    even with      s police cars and cops looking all over for him steadily throughout    he never gets seen or nabbed   he sees daily newspapers reporting his   crimes    this i liked  because it gave the thin plot an extension  after all  it s a movie  see  fiction    director iris iliopulos does what i think is everything possible to    bring wood s vision to fruition and    give it an updated feel  yet have shots of authentic    s police cars intertwined with  ahh  local l a      stores    so well hence my   rating  if the period and props were authentic    i would have given it a     now it wraps it self up kinda weird and i won t spoil it for anyone but let s just say the final ending is somewhat disappointing for it  to me  it had promise  action and comedy    all up till the end  so   with all that said   locate a copy at your own discretion   just realize that  as there is no dialouge  except for some narration and singing  this may be up your alley    maybe not   but i definitely think it s worth a watch  the actors all do fine performances and it s only the inconsistency in proper period pieces that really made me long for just that correction    then i would say by all means check this film out for it s not like anything these studios put out these days  or will in the future  too  i am sure  \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\":
